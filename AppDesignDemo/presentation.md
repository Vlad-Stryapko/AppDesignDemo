### ServicesAndRepos
#### Pros:
1. Easy to understand and pick-up
2. Offer some level of SoC via layers 
#### Cons
1. Layers themselves become large and complex
2. Things related to one feature are scattered amongst different projects and solutions
3. Despite the initial goal, don't offer that much of a database abstraction 
4. Reposiories are used mainly for DB, even though they make sense for 3p APIs, files, etc
