### Quick about 
Vlad Stryapko
.NET developer, interested in functional programming, type systems and type-driven development 

### Why does design matter?
1. Reasoning about the code 
2. Common code structure across the service(s)
3. Potentially decreasing the cost of changes 
4. It might be just fun
5. etc

### Goals
1. Be explicit about what is done in the module 
2. Understand the idea (at a high level) only by the signature - we're too lazy to read the code 
3. Easy to debug 
4. Easy to write even for junior-level developers
