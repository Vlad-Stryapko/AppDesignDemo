### Workflows and cqrs
#### Pros:
1. All the dependencies are explicit, thus making reasoning about the code much easier
2. Easy to setup UTs 
3. Clear separation of main flows and their dependencies
4. Easy to debug and navigate the code
#### Cons
1. Might lead to code duplication
2. Requires a bit more typing (unless some generators are used)
